# Palendrome Checker

In this coding challenge, you'll create a React application that takes a word as input from the user and determines whether it's a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards as it does backwards (e.g., "level" or "madam").

Your task is to create a form with an input field and a submit button. When the user submits the form, the application should display either "This is a palindrome" or "This is NOT a palindrome" depending on the input.
